# User Input Validation with Python

This is a simple Python program that prompts the user to input their email address, phone number, and a website URL. The program uses regular expressions (regex) to validate each input. If an input is invalid, the user is prompted to try again. Once all inputs are valid, the program prints a "Thank you!" message and exits.
